Shakespeare ðŸŽ­ â€” "Expectations are pre-meditated resentments"

Larry Wall, the creator of Perl, identified three virtues of a
great programmer: laziness, impatience, and hubris. Wall believed
these virtues were passions and strengths that could help
programmers succeed:

### Laziness

The quality of making an effort to reduce energy expenditure,
such as by writing programs that save labor, documenting work,
and eliminating wasteful movements.

### Impatience

The anger felt when a computer is being slow, which can lead to
writing programs that anticipate the user's needs.

### Hubris

The quality of writing and maintaining programs that others won't
want to criticize.

Some say that these virtues are not flaws, but strengths in
software engineering.
