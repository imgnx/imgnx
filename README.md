## `./public/modules`

All Bounties and otherwise "outside" requests will go into the [./public/modules](./public/modules).

- The folder and repo are named after the ticket number for anonymization. This is a privilege, not a right. If someone gives me a reason to stop doing that, I will start open sourcing every single ticket, and no I've never signed an NDA.

## Domains

Internal repositories (submodules) go into [Domains](./Domains).

- The first level is the TLD
- The second level is the "name" of the domain
- The thirds level is the subdomain
- Each subdomain has its own repository

## Recommended Settings

It's recommended that you exclude `**/*env*` from VS Code or otherwise the IDE of your choice.

This will allow you to "safely" go public and navigate your IDE at the same time.
(eg. if you stream on <https://twitch.tv>)

```settings.json
{
    "files.exclude": {
        "**/*env*": true
    }
}
```
