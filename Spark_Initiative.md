# IMGNX ⚡️ Spark

## Open Source Initiative

"Igniting Imagination through Open Collaboration"

Initiative Overview: IMGNX Spark is a community-driven open-source initiative that invites developers, creators, and innovators to collaborate on groundbreaking projects. The focus is on fostering creativity and providing a platform where ideas can come to life through shared code, design, and innovation.

Motivation/Reward: Every quarter, IMGNX will spotlight the most imaginative and impactful contributors, offering them a "Creativity Grant" — a cash reward or support for further project development. In addition, top contributors will get exclusive "IMGNX Spark" badges, social media recognition, and invitations to special online workshops or in-person creative meetups with industry experts.
